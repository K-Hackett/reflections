When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use a remote repository to back up my local repository. I'd also go remote if I was going to collaborate or work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to create a different branch for recent changes. Git can't think for you so it's better to do it manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Use forks when you don't have permission to change a repository or when you're continuing work on another repository on your own. Clones when going between remote and local. Branches when you got separate ideas.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can continue the work or if you want the remote to be up to date you can just push when convenient.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I'd use cloud services where I can share like Google Drive, Docs or OneDrive or OneNote. It'd be harder b/c it'd be hard to keep track of changes between multiple contributors.
