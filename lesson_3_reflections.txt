When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use a remote repository to back up my local repository. I'd also go remote if I was going to collaborate or work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may want to create a different branch for recent changes. Git can't think for you so it's better to do it manually.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Use forks when you don't have permission to change a repository or when you're continuing work on another repository on your own. Clones when going between remote and local. Branches when you got separate ideas.
