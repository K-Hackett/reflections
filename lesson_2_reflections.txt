What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a git repository it creates a .git file in that directory. You need to do it so you can start tracking the history of that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory is just the directory you're currently in. The repository is the .git working directory w/ history information, etc. The staging area I guess is where you go to make the commits.
